# 🌀 CLI Utilities – Public Edition

Your terminal doesn’t deserve silence. It deserves life.

This repository is a carefully built collection of **CLI utilities** — ranging from **animations that dance in your terminal** to **string-based tricks and utilities** — all made in **pure C/C++**, without touching a single external library.

It’s not a framework.
It’s not a package.
It’s raw. It’s lightweight. It’s modern.

Think of it as the **art of controlling the terminal with nothing but C/C++ and imagination.**

## ✦ Why This Exists

Most repositories are bloated. They either hide behind wrappers, depend on half the internet, or collapse outside their intended environment.
This project is different:

* **Pure C/C++** — nothing foreign, nothing external.
* **Minimalist but powerful** — utilities that *just work* without noise.
* **Modern C principles** — keeping code clean, safe, and extendable.
* **Linux-based at the core** — designed to leverage `unistd.h` for timing and control.
* **Strict, no-nonsense design** — every addition has a purpose.

This is not about creating another library. It’s about **taking control of the terminal** with precision.

---

## ✦ What’s Inside (Public Edition)

The **Public Edition** provides a handful of utilities, including:

* Animations like rotating slashes, bouncing balls, dancing brackets.
* Fun counters (forward and reverse).
* Experimental “eyes” animations 👀.
* Tiny tricks to bring movement and variation to otherwise static output.

The code is lean, the utilities are self-contained, and nothing drags you down with dependency hell.

---

## ✦ What’s Not Inside (Yet)

There is a **Pro Edition.**
This public repo is just the surface. The Pro build introduces:

* **Color-coded outputs** with extended palette support.
* **Adjustable speeds and repetitions** for total control.
* **Extra animation sets** — more dynamic, more expressive.
* **Safety & sanity checks** (so you don’t crash your terminal).
* And yes, utilities I won’t even *name* here.

The Pro Edition is not free-use. It’s not public.
But it exists — and can be shared upon request.

---

## ✦ Compatibility

* Designed for **modern C/C++**.
* Built for **Linux-based systems**.
* Uses **unistd.h**, so **Windows support is partial** (some utilities may fail or require adaptation).

This isn’t about universal hand-holding. It’s about **making Linux terminals shine**.

---

## ✦ Roadmap

Every version adds **one or more new utilities**, keeping things modular and unbloated.
Versioning is intentional:

* **v1.x** – Public base utilities.
* **vPro.x** – Private extended features.

Future experiments include:

* **New CLI animations** that move beyond simple tricks.
* **String transformations** for fun and utility.
* **Terminal illusions** that test the limits of C output.

Follow the repo. Because what comes next won’t be repeated.

---

## ✦ Closing Note

This repo isn’t meant to be *just code*. It’s an exploration.
A way of showing what **raw C/C++ can do inside a terminal**, when stripped of wrappers and distractions.

The public version is fun. The Pro version is dangerous.
And the story is just starting.

🔥 **If you thought C/C++ was old and boring, this will remind you why it still rules.**

Do you want me to make the **tone sharper and bolder** (like “you either get it or you don’t” style, almost intimidating),
or keep it this **professional but teasing** vibe?
