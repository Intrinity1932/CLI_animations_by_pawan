# 🌀 Terminal Animation Library

### *Because your terminal deserves more than “Hello World.”*

---

## ⚡ The Idea

The terminal has been underestimated for too long.
Flat, black, boring text — that’s the default.

But what if your terminal could **move**?
What if instead of dead characters, you had **living animations** — spinning slashes, bouncing balls, blinking eyes, bracket doors that *open and close*?

That’s the purpose of this library.
It doesn’t just print text — it gives your terminal a **heartbeat**.

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

This library isn’t for everyone. Let’s keep it honest.

* **Students** who want to flex in front of peers.
* **Teachers** who want their C/C++ classes to *wake up*.
* **Hackers & enthusiasts** who like bending low-level tools into **unusual art**.
* **Developers** who appreciate code that’s playful, sharp, and different.

If you fall in these categories, this repo is exactly for you.

## 🆓 The Base Version (this repo)

This repo is the **base version**. It’s fun, it works, but it’s deliberately limited.

* Fixed animation speed
* No colors or gradients
* Core animations only

### Included Animations

✔ Rotating Slash (`- \ | /`)
✔ Ball Bounce (`_ o O o _`)
✔ Bracket Dance (`() [] {}`)
✔ Counting (forward + reverse)
✔ Eyes (blinking, shifting, playful)
✔ Bracket Doors `( )`, `[ ]`, `{ }`

### Example

```cpp
#include "animation.cpp"

int main() {
    animation.rotating_slash();
    animation.eyes_2();
}
```

Run it → watch your terminal flicker alive.

## 🔒 The Pro Version (Private Repo)

Yes, there’s a **Pro version**.
No, you won’t find it here.

The Pro version unlocks what the base version *denies*:

* Adjustable speed & fine-grained control
* ANSI color and gradient effects
* Extended animation sets (progress bars, chains, loaders, dynamic faces)
* Terminal tricks that make it feel like a **tiny animation engine**

But:

* It’s private.
* It’s not free-to-use.
* It’s available only by direct request.

This repo is the **teaser**. The Pro repo is the **weapon**.

---

## 🤔 Why Use This At All?

Because **surprise creates impact**.

* A teacher shows animations in a C/C++ class → students sit up.
* A student presents their project → classmates forget the others and *remember theirs*.
* A hacker runs scripts → someone glances at the screen and asks: *“Wait, how did you do that?”*

This is more than code.
It’s a **performance**.

---

## ⚠️ Final Note

* This repo = **Base Version** → public, free, limited.
* The itch you feel? That’s intentional.
* The **Pro Version** exists, but it’s private and not free-to-use.

👉 You choose: stick with the toy, or unlock the showpiece.

## 💡 Bonus

Yes — this library works in **both C and C++**.
Write your programs in either language, drop the file in, include it, and the animations are yours.
